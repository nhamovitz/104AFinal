# 104AFinal
Reinventing inter-frame video compression using interpolation. UCSB Math 104A Final Project. See [the technical report](Final%20Project%20Report.pdf) for more details. (Note: work on the project was performed with Rianna Alers and Emma Opper; the report only has my name because we all wrote separate reports.)
